        <p role="heading">｢ Macros as cognitive catalysts in digital performance ｣</p>
        <p>Consider real-time applications, such as audio signal processing in the context of live performance. One manipulation might be mapped to one operation, such as:</p>
<p>‹Moving one continuous controller› <em>means</em> ‹modulating amplitude proportionally›.</p>
<p>However, if we consider the natural behavior of e.g. acoustic wind instruments, we find ourselves yearning one manipulation mapped to multiple signal processing operations – nature is complex and made of interrelated substances that react together, not in isolation! In this case:</p>
<p>‹If a wind instrument’s sound is louder›, ‹there will probably be more high harmonics› (the sound is brighter).</p>
<p>Amplitude and frequency content change together. So we want this relation:</p>
<p>‹Moving one continuous controller› <em>means that</em> ‹amplitude is modulated proportionally› <em>and</em> ‹harmonics are added according to amplitude increase›.</p>
<p>The manipulation’s quantity acts as parameter for two interrelated operations. The quantity is <em>substituted</em> twice in the resulting operation set. The combined operation, from the performer’s perspective, is <em>one</em> act and can be cognitively apprehended as such, which respects the inherent complexity of the performance and gives the performer more <em>power</em>. The combined operation is a substitution (macro) defined in a statement and becomes a meaningful, useful item in a technical vocabulary. This is called ordaining technology to the needs of a given domain, and is the culturally sound thing to do.</p>
