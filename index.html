        <p>Be it in visual or sonic domains, I strive to reveal the
        power that modular thinking brings to design and
        problem-solving. I believe in a digital literacy where all
        actors – be they creatives, technicals, leaders or supporters
        – feel empowered and work according to the strengths of their
          respective cultures.</p>

          content production ｣</p>
        <p class="dms_anchor-pad">My <a href="https://waidanian.github.io/organic-tex-demo/">Organic
          TeX Demo</a> shows how TeX / LaTeX, Emacs Org-mode and other
          document formats based on macros can be used to produce
          high-fidelity content for the Web. The demo, for the initial
          phase of this ongoing effort, focuses on text content, but I
          shall show in a soon-to-be-released project that all kinds
          of graphics can also be produced in the same workflow,
          bringing to the Web some classic techniques
          promoting <em>density of information</em> and <em>cognitive
          efficiency</em> in the tradition of Edward Tufte’s analytic
          design. The workflow has already been extensively tested in
          production, in the context of
          the <a href="https://github.com/HU15/">HU15</a> group’s
          publishing work in the digital humanities.</p>

        <li>The <a href="http://tug.org/">TeX Users Group</a>’s
          activity calendar is looking very good again this year. Do
          stay tuned on the website, eventually through its XML feeds,
          in order to learn first-hand about the latest developments
          in the community that develops and maintains the very best
            suite of document production tools!</li>
        <li>Québec City’s
          ‘<a href="https://semainenumerique.com/">Digital
          Week</a>’ <code>(fr)</code> is on the horizon. I will be
          attending several events,
          especially <a href="https://webaquebec.org/">WAQ17</a> <code>(fr)</code>
          and the famed Warp Zone! I am pleased to see this
          multi-event grow and become more and more inclusive of the
          various fields that make up the Digital Domain.</li>

        <p role="heading">｢ Macros as cognitive catalysts in digital
        performance ｣</p>
        <p><time datetime="2016-12-21">2016-12-21</time></p>
        <p>Consider real-time applications, such as audio signal
        processing in the context of live performance. One
        manipulation might be mapped to one operation, such as:</p>
        <p class="dms_proposition">‹Moving one continuous
        controller› <em>means</em> ‹modulating amplitude
        proportionally›.</p>
        <p>However, if we consider the natural behavior of
        e.g. acoustic wind instruments, we find ourselves yearning one
        manipulation mapped to multiple signal processing operations –
        nature is complex and made of interrelated substances that
        react together, not in isolation! In this case:</p>
        <p class="dms_proposition">‹If a wind instrument’s sound is
        louder›, ‹there will probably be more high harmonics› (the
        sound is brighter).</p>
        <p>Amplitude and frequency content change together. So we want
        this relation:</p>
        <p class="dms_proposition">‹Moving one continuous
        controller› <em>means that</em> ‹amplitude is modulated
        proportionally› <em>and</em> ‹harmonics are added according to
        amplitude increase›.</p>
        <p>The manipulation’s quantity acts as parameter for two
        interrelated operations. The quantity is <em>substituted</em>
        twice in the resulting operation set. The combined operation,
        from the performer’s perspective, is <em>one</em> act and can
        be cognitively apprehended as such, which respects the
        inherent complexity of the performance and gives the performer
        more <em>power</em>. The combined operation is a substitution
        (macro) defined in a statement and becomes a meaningful,
        useful item in a technical vocabulary. This is an example of
        ordaining technology to the needs of a given domain, and is
        the culturally sound thing to do.</p>
