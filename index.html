        <p class="dms_anchor-pad">My <a href="https://waidanian.github.io/organic-tex-demo/">Organic
          TeX Demo</a> shows how TeX / LaTeX, Emacs Org-mode and other
          document formats based on macros can be used to produce
          high-fidelity content for the Web. The demo, for the initial
          phase of this ongoing effort, focuses on text content, but I
          shall show in a soon-to-be-released project that all kinds
          of graphics can also be produced in the same workflow,
          bringing to the Web some classic techniques
          promoting <em>density of information</em> and <em>cognitive
          efficiency</em> in the tradition of Edward Tufte’s analytic
          design. The workflow has already been extensively tested in
          production, in the context of
          the <a href="https://github.com/HU15/">HU15</a> group’s
          publishing work in the digital
          humanities.</p>

        <p class="dms_anchor-pad">While working as a teaching
        assistant in an introductory programming course designed for
        Computer Science and Software Engineering students, I realized
        that students often struggle to grasp the practical importance
        of recursion when it is first taught to them using binary
        search trees and suchlike. I designed a new exercise about
        writing recursive functions that parse narrative XHTML
        documents, precisely the kind of recursive data structure that
        is extremely common on the Web. Here is an impression of the
        resulting module, along with an earnest proposition to write a
        new module implementing the same algorithms within an
          industry-standard framework.</p>

        <li>The Raspberry Pi Foundation has
          announced <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/helloworld">a
          new publication, a magazine entitled <i>HelloWorld</i></a>,
          supporting the community of educators in the UK and beyond
          who integrate computing into their curricular
          activities. The first issue is available now. I find myself
          particularly awed by the article running pp.&nbsp;18–20
          about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert">Seymour
          Papert</a>’s influential view of education. As the author
          puts it: profound education means that learning is
          recognized as an act of becoming, and I would add
          becoming <em>oneself</em>, progressively. In particular,
          computing is an extremely powerful tool for this
          transformation. Now look, I’m placing beacons here: I am
          using the Raspberry Pi (and other devices similar in spirit)
          in key projects within an educational context, and I do
          intend to make the young-at-heart who work with me embark on
          a wholesome cognitive journey... Stay tuned.</li>
        <li>The <a href="http://tug.org/">TeX Users Group</a>’s
          activity calendar is looking very good again this year. Do
          stay tuned on the website, eventually through its XML feeds,
          in order to learn first-hand about the latest developments
          in the community that develops and maintains the very best
            suite of document production tools!</li>
        <li>Québec City’s
          ‘<a href="https://semainenumerique.com/">Digital
          Week</a>’ <code>(fr)</code> is on the horizon. I will be
          attending several events,
          especially <a href="https://webaquebec.org/">WAQ17</a> <code>(fr)</code>
          and the famed Warp Zone! I am pleased to see this
          multi-event grow and become more and more inclusive of the
          various fields that make up the Digital Domain.</li>

        <p role="heading">｢&nbsp;Macros as cognitive catalysts in digital
        performance&nbsp;｣</p>
        <p class="dms_post-heading-addendum"><time datetime="2016-12-21">2016-12-21</time></p>
        <p>Consider real-time applications, such as audio signal
        processing in the context of live performance. One
        manipulation might be mapped to one operation, such as:</p>
        <p class="dms_proposition">‹Moving one continuous
        controller› <em>means</em> ‹modulating amplitude
        proportionally›.</p>
        <p>However, if we consider the natural behavior of
        e.g. acoustic wind instruments, we find ourselves yearning one
        manipulation mapped to multiple signal processing operations –
        nature is complex and made of interrelated substances that
        react together, not in isolation! In this case:</p>
        <p class="dms_proposition">‹If a wind instrument’s sound is
        louder›, ‹there will probably be more high harmonics› (the
        sound is brighter).</p>
        <p>Amplitude and frequency content change together. So we want
        this relation:</p>
        <p class="dms_proposition">‹Moving one continuous
        controller› <em>means that</em> ‹amplitude is modulated
        proportionally› <em>and</em> ‹harmonics are added according to
        amplitude increase›.</p>
        <p>The manipulation’s quantity acts as parameter for two
        interrelated operations. The quantity is <em>substituted</em>
        twice in the resulting operation set. The combined operation,
        from the performer’s perspective, is <em>one</em> act and can
        be cognitively apprehended as such, which respects the
        inherent complexity of the performance and gives the performer
        more <em>power</em>. The combined operation is a substitution
        (macro) defined in a statement and becomes a meaningful,
        useful item in a technical vocabulary. This is an example of
        ordaining technology to the needs of a given domain, and is
        the culturally sound thing to do.</p>
