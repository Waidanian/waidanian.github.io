        </header>
        <p>While working as a teaching assistant in an introductory
        programming course designed for Computer Science and Software
        Engineering students, I realized that students often struggle
        to grasp the practical importance of recursion when it is
        first taught to them using binary search trees and suchlike. I
        designed a new exercise about writing recursive functions that
        parse narrative XHTML documents: precisely the kind of
        recursive data structure that most programmers are bound to
        encounter in their working lives, whether their language is
        low- or high-level and whether they work with numeric or
        symbolic data. Here is an impression of the resulting module,
        along with an earnest proposition to write a new module
        implementing the same algorithms within an industry-standard
          framework.</p>
        <p>The code presented below is not exactly the same as that
        developed for the course, and out of respect for the CS
        department’s policy I will not reproduce the actual document
        handed out to students, which gave them the proper context and
        materials along with the functional specs to fulfill. The
        course material has not been released under an open license
        (to the best of my knowledge), so I will not apply such a
        license to this present page. Instead, I am inviting the
        reader to check back on this site for the upcoming
        announcement of a separate public GitHub project in a similar
        application domain – a project that has been inspired by this
        ‘Level 0’ module, but with more complete functionality and
        real applicability. The code below could probably be useful,
        but I will not make a separate repository out of it. What
        I <em>am</em> offering here is a report on a pedagogical
        project, the analysis of which could be very useful for
        teachers and learners alike.</p>
        <p>Special thanks go
          to <a href="https://github.com/jeanfrancisroy">Jean-Francis
          Roy</a>, who taught the course and with whom I worked as a
          TA. He developed an excellent course, supported my
          initiative and edited my code, in particular helping me
          figure out what I actually wanted to write in
          the <code>first_descendant</code> function shown below.
        </p>
        <p>Here is the module’s preamble:</p>
        <p class="dms_multiline-proglang">
          <code>
<span class="c1"># This program requires Python 3.6 or newer, as it uses the new</span>
<span class="c1"># formatted string literals, type annotations and other goodies.</span>

<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">xml.etree.ElementTree</span> <span class="kn">as</span> <span class="nn">ET</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">typing</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Union</span>
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>We are working with the <i>ElementTree</i> module from the
          standard library. This is a refreshing alternative to the
          Document Object Model for random-access into a whole XML
          document, with a few quirks. In particular, the module
          cleverly only needs two classes for the actual XML document:
          one for the whole tree and another for elements with all
          their associated data. In particular, because everything is
          attached to element instances, each ‘element’ is actually a
          structure consisting of the XML element, its attributes as a
          dictionary, the first child text node if there is one, a
          list of children elements and the following-sibling text
          node if there is one. See what this entails? It is somehow
          reminiscent of Lisp’s <code>car</code> and
          <code>cdr</code> (oops sorry I mean <code>head</code>
          and <code>tail</code> <kbd>;-)</kbd>
          ) constructs. Very pedagogical indeed.</p>
        <p>When this was taught, Python 3.6 had not yet been
        released. Now that it has been, I joyfully add type
        annotations whenever I can. I appreciate dynamic typing, but I
        find it very useful for learning purposes that functions and
        variables can now be annotated with a clear, uniform syntax
        that does not run contrary to Python’s core syntax. Even
        though no programmatic use is made of the annotations here, I
        find them helpful for reasoning about what is being done in
        each block.</p>
        <p role="heading">Extracting the text content</p>
        <p>The module’s functions accomplish work that is actually
        useful, but they were conceived first and foremost for their
        pedagogical value. The function below accomplishes a task that
        is similarly carried out by a pre-existing function in the
          <i>ElementTree</i> module: <code>itertext</code>. However,
          the student is not needlessly replicating work, because I
          decided to go further and require that certain essential
          attribute values be included in the text content
          sequence; <code>itertext</code> does not do that and I don’t
          know if it would be extensible to do so. My function also
          requires the student to learn what <em>document order</em>
          means.

        </p>
        <p>As a useful extra, a simple function appends the values of
        certain attributes that could be part of the phrasing
        content’s text nodes. We are not setting out to write a
        HTML-to-Markdown converter, but this little function alone
          gives us an idea of what that would entail.</p>

        <p role="heading">Selecting the first descendant by name</p>
        <p>The following function can be considered equivalent to the
          CSS selector ‘<code>parent descendant:first-of-type</code>’.
          This is very useful, for example in situations where one
        needs to extract a content block without having to predict
        exactly at what depth it lies. The <i>ElementTree</i> module
        contains some minimal XPath support, but I have explicitly
        avoided that because in my experience, it confuses people and
        makes them think that selecting XML nodes is an esoteric
        operation that can only be carried out by specialized
        declarative languages. Here, we are working with a
        general-purpose imperative programming language and yet the
        function is elegant and simple!

        </p>
        <p>This is a good starting point for working with narrative
        XML in real scenarios. Of course, you will tell me that in
        real working situations the functions should be methods
        defined in a new class that inherits
        from <code>ET.Element</code>, and I agree with you! However, I
        had initially defined my module in this simplistic way because
        the students were being taught recursion with functions
        generally defined at the module level. This is legitimate in
        the sense that Python can also be used in a functional style,
        in which the use of classes would be more conservative and
        instead higher-order functions would be defined, for
        instance. I would have liked going so far as to introduce some
        classic higher-order functions, but unfortunately there was no
        time (semesters always seem so short when teaching).</p>
