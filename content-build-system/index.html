In order to produce great content and integrate it successfully into a
website or app, the case has already been made for <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/05/content-first-prototyping/">starting with
content during the prototyping phase</a> and <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/content-out-layout">building the canvas from
the content instead of the opposite</a>. Also, with the rise of modern
build tools for Web development, many options have emerged and they
have been extensively surveyed by the community,
<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/10/building-web-applications-with-make/">along with their classic alternatives</a>.
</p>

<p>
For a content designer, it makes sense to put all this together and
set out to find a build system that works well for content. Using a
content build system should result in improved content workflows that
help reduce friction between the work of content editors, designers
and developers. It should also help deliver quality products more
consistently to the integrators, who will be handed assets that feel
substantial and fall into place naturally within the site or app
structure.
</p>

<p>
In my work with scientific or academic organizations, I’ve been led to
use different content building workflows depending on the respective
practices of the creators on the one hand and the developers or
integrators on the other. I will be presenting one possible workflow
that targets a static website with technical content, using both
venerable tools like <code>make</code> and shiny modern formats like SVG and
CommonMark. The emphasis will be on the programmatic techniques that
convene with text content that is highly structured (with
e.g. WAI-ARIA accessibility markup) and finely styled (with modern CSS
respecting recommended practices). I will also mention alternatives
(for example, Gulp in place of <code>make</code>) in order to show general
applicability.
</p>

<p role="heading">Content acquisition phase</p>
<p>
If I am working on a pre-existing website, I make sure to start with
the actual content that is already in the wild and has been serving
its purpose with real users.
</p>

<p>
I use a HTML content selection tool to make “atomic” files of the
blocks identified as self-contained content units in the original HTML
page. This is one of the first steps in my typical <code>make</code> file.
</p>

<p role="heading">Atomic content styling</p>
<p>
Because the content atoms have been extracted into separate files,
they can be included as individual content frames in my SVG/ODG, PDF
or PNG prototype. The software used for graphical prototyping does not
come into the scope of the present article <i>per se</i>, but I will
provide a more detailed account of it elsewhere. Now this is an
important detail: ideally my graphical prototype
<em>references</em> the content atoms, so by default they remain as
separate files and don’t need to be explicitly re-included if I modify
them from outside. This allows me to lead the <i>content
prototyping</i> (acquisition) and the <i>content styling</i> steps
concurrently. Right now, LibreOffice (ODG, SVG and PDF), GIMP (PNG)
and the TeX system (SVG and PDF) are my tools of choice for that
because they have some intrinsic advantages when working with
highly-structured HTML, but of course many alternatives exist. You can
consider the prototyping tool like another swappable module in the
system I’m describing here. In fact, not all projects require these
tools for prototyping; I like to prototype directly in HTML and CSS
when the context is right.
</p>

<p role="heading">Disposition in canvas</p>
<p>
The definitions of <i>content atom</i> and <i>canvas</i> here will depend on
multiple variables given by the domain and the particular
project. Typically, a content atom can be an <code>article</code> element if each
article is short, but if the whole content run is lengthier each atom
might be a <code>section</code>. Now it’s important to remember that, in the
modern HTML world-view, <code>section</code> elements are very different from
<code>div</code> elements and I believe it is proper to enclose content in as
many sections as necessary.
</p>

<p>
Structuring the content in this way has many advantages over simply
relying on the sequence of <code>h1</code> ... <code>h6</code>
elements dispersed among paragraphs. <code>section</code> elements add
paired delimiters that make more relations explicit, which in turn
makes contextual styling and transclusion easier. The elusive “HTML
layout algorithm” might have been shunned by the mainstream HTML5
implementations, but at any rate nothing prevents us from adding more
structure around the parts of content runs! In HTML5.1, we are even
explicitly allowed to add a <code>header</code> element as the first
element of any enclosing <code>section</code> – it will even
automatically receive a different ARIA role from that of the page’s
outermost <code>header</code>. This is great for e.g. titling blocks
containing ancillary information items that must receive their own
scoped style rules.
</p>

<p>
Beyond the atomic runs, the canvas styling proper refers to the local
“narrative” layout, which can be handled by CSS modules such as
Flexbox – more on that below.
</p>

<p role="heading">Content plate build</p>
<p>
This is the step that can be automated more easily. Once the assets
are ready, the modules can be assembled into what I like to call a
<i>plate</i>. I do not say <i>page</i>, because the final HTML page that
actually gets published might be handled further downstream depending
on the organization’s needs. The plate is the content set in its
canvas, bringing with it all of the scoped styles necessary for its
full interpretation.
</p>

<p>
The main tasks here are actually transclusion and validation. Much of
the work done here is what is traditionally associated with template
processors, server-side includes and suchlike.
</p>

<p role="heading">A “grammar” of prototyping and building</p>
<p>
All that we have seen so far is a series of conditional steps, with
varying numbers and levels of sub-task at each step. There happens to
exist a convenient way to represent such processes both schematically
and operationally: grammatical forms. Below is a BNF-like grammar that
sums up the steps I have described in the previous sections. Following
early examples, I use the arrow as the derivation metasymbol, since it
works just as well as the established <code>::=</code> but is arguably
clearer. It’s also very enlightening to note that in its original use,
BNF encourages natural-language descriptions in the angled brackets
and that these variable expressions were originally called <i>classes</i>
(in the mathematical sense). In our case, the variables represent
<i>classes of tasks</i>.

    〈 <var>Flexbox composition</var> 〉
  | 〈 <var>Grid layout</var> 〉
  | 〈 <var>Block positioning</var> 〉;

</code>
</p>

<p>
I use the expression “HTML∘CSS composition”, with a relation
composition operator, very much on purpose: in this step, the correct
<i>discursive</i> placement of content items respects the standards and
best practices, with special regard to the HTML <i>content categories</i>,
the use of idiomatic, scoped CSS, and a reasoned separation of
concerns between the emphasis structure notation (HTML) and the
graphical designation language (CSS). The resulting structure is very
much a <i>product</i> type, since the <i>meaning</i> of the content is complete
within a given canvas; the emphasis structure <i>and</i> the graphical
style make a complete meaningful item.
</p>

<p>
In that line of thought, I must put emphasis on my deep appreciation
for Flexbox. I have written <i>Flexbox composition</i> because I think the
Flexbox module is the most appropriate so far for logical
composition. It encourages one to make content structures that can
show their inner relations by way of the style rules themselves. In
much the same way that Python is sometimes called <i>executable
pseudocode</i>, I would be tempted to call Flexbox an <i>interpretable
modular style guide</i>.
</p>

<p>
In the <i>content plate build</i> phase, the first item in the sequence is
named <i>atom conclusion</i>, where <i>conslusion</i> has its etymological
sense. What I mean to convey is that node sequences, considered as
sets, will be both <i>included</i> within other sets and <i>concatenated</i>
into a canvas that can then be apprehended graphically (a visual
sum). Here again I playfully use theoretical vocabulary in what is
nonetheless a reasoned way.
</p>

<p>
Depending on the tools at each step, conversions might happen multiple
times both to and from HTML. The rule that I set for myself is: though
some format pairings make round-trip conversions impractical or
downright impossible, all data items in the source should appear in
some form in the destination; if a data item cannot be sensibly
reused, that poses the question of whether that data item was
correctly encoded to begin with.
</p>

<p>
Not all class variables are fully derived to terminal steps; they
could be, but that is not the main point. The main point is that this
description drives further improvements to the workflow and,
correspondingly, the build script (<i>makefile</i> or otherwise). Thanks to
that, I can leave you with both a concrete tool and a more abstract
methodology that can be usefully adapted to many domains.
